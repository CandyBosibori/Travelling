    <p>Travel gives us our greatest stories,
         our most cherished memories and countless 
         irreplaceable learnings that we can choose
          to pay forward to others. It teaches us 
          about ourselves and each other, it broadens 
          our horizons and, just like a reset button,
          it forces us to refocus on what really matters.</p>

        <h3> Advantages of travelling</h3>

            </li>
            <li>Traveling Can Help You Make Memorable Memories</li>

            <p>A lot of people around the world travel every year to many places. Moreover, it is important to travel to humans. Some travel to learn more while some travel to take a break from their life. No matter the reason, travelling opens a big door for us to explore the world beyond our imagination and indulge in many things.

            <p>In 1916, New York University leased the eighth floor and eventually occupied the entire building. The building was donated to the university in 1929 by Frederick Brown and has been used continuously as an academic building</p>

            <p>This enormous crater lake consists of an island almost the size of Singapore in its center. At over 1,145 square km, and a depth of 450 meters, Lake Toba is actually more like an ocean. This is the largest lake in Southeast Asia and one of the deepest lakes in the world.</p>

            <p>The layout of streets and the spaces buildings enclose give each settlement a distinctive character. The tightly enclosed lanes of Hawkshead and Hartsop contrast to the spacious character of Caldbeck and Askham. Settlements develop differently for many reasons. For example, the market places of Broughton and Keswick reflect their importance as local trading centres whereas Troutbeck's elongated shape developed along a line of spring-fed wells.
